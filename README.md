# React Portfolio

## Task and Description

This is portfoilo that is modified from https://taeyoungp.github.io/Module2_Challenge/ and built using REACT.js.

The purpose of this portfolio is not only for applying jobs but also to share works with other developers and collaborate on projects.

You’ll deploy this application to GitHub Pages. Follow the instructions in the Git Guide or consult the [Create React App Docs on GitHub Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) to create a build that you can deploy.

**Important**: Be sure to push your codebase to the default branch in GitHub -- NOT your built and deployed code. Ensure this happens by using the `gh-pages` branch to host the deployed application's build.
